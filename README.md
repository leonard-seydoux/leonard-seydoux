## Hi there!

I'm Léonard Seydoux, a geophysicist and data scientist at the [institut de physique du globe de Paris](https://www.ipgp.fr/en) as a junior professor at [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/en/).

I mostly study earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. My research analyzes subtle geophysical signals, including [slow earthquakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_earthquake), using artificial intelligence and machine learning. I combine [high-performance computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing), [array-based seismic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_array), and advanced [signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing) to link these signals to major geological events. I focus on AI-driven hazard assessment, reconstruction of sparse or historical datasets, and multiscale monitoring of fault and volcanic systems, while integrating software development, teaching, and collaborative supervision to connect computational geophysics with practical understanding of Earth's dynamics.

The core mathematical object of the package is the network covariance matrix, used for signal detection, source separation, localisation, and plane-wave beamforming. The signal detection and processing methods are based on the analysis of the covariance matrix spectrum. The covariance matrix can be used as input for classical array processing tools such as beamforming and inter-station cross-correlations. |

It is built on top of Covseisnet and leverages covariance matrix analysis for efficient seismic data processing. The package includes pre-trained models for various seismic signal types, including earthquakes, volcanic tremors, and anthropogenic noise. Scatseisnet is designed to be user-friendly and easily integrable into existing seismic data analysis workflows.|

It allows users to easily apply a wide range of color palettes to their visualizations, enhancing the aesthetic appeal and interpretability of geospatial and scientific data plots. The package supports various CPT formats and provides functions for loading, converting, and applying these color palettes in Matplotlib.|
